  "body": "Similar to NumPy, Pandas is one of the most widely used python libraries in data science. It provides high-performance, easy to use structures and data analysis tools. Unlike NumPy library which provides objects for multi-dimensional arrays, Pandas provides in-memory 2d table object called Dataframe. It is like a spreadsheet with column names and row labels.\nHence, with 2d tables, pandas is capable of providing many additional functionalities like creating pivot tables, computing columns based on other columns and plotting graphs.\n->>Pandas can be imported into Python using:\n>>> import pandas as pd\n\nSome commonly used data structures in pandas are:\n1)Series objects: 1D array, similar to a column in a spreadsheet\n2)DataFrame objects: 2D table, similar to a spreadsheet\n3)Panel objects: Dictionary of DataFrames, similar to sheet in MS Excel\n\nPandas Series object is created using pd.Series function. Each row is provided with an index and by defaults is assigned numerical values starting from 0. Like NumPy, Pandas also provide the basic mathematical functionalities like addition, subtraction and conditional operations and broadcasting.\nPandas dataframe object represents a spreadsheet with cell values, column names, and row index labels. Dataframe can be visualized as dictionaries of Series. Dataframe rows and columns are simple and intuitive to access. Pandas also provide SQL-like functionality to filter, sort rows based on conditions."
