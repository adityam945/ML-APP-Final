  "body": "NumPy stands for ‘Numerical Python’ or ‘Numeric Python’. It is an open source module of Python which provides fast mathematical computation on arrays and matrices. Since, arrays and matrices are an essential part of the Machine Learning ecosystem, NumPy along with Machine Learning modules like Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, etc. complete the Python Machine Learning Ecosystem.\n\nNumPy provides the essential multi-dimensional array-oriented computing functionalities designed for high-level mathematical functions and scientific computation. Numpy can be imported into the notebook using\n\nImporting Numpy->>\n>>> import numpy as np\n\nNumPy’s main object is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It is a table with same type elements, i.e, integers or string or characters (homogeneous), usually integers. In NumPy, dimensions are called axes. The number of axes is called the rank.\nThere are several ways to create an array in NumPy like np.array, np.zeros, no.ones, etc. Each of them provides some flexibility.\nCommand to create an array:\n\t\t1)np.array\n\t\t2)np.ones\n\t\t3)np.full\n\t\t4)np.arange\n\t\t5)np.linspace\n\t\t6)np.random.rand(2,3)\n\t\t7)np.empty((2,3))\n-->Some of the important attributes of a NumPy object are:\n1.Ndim: displays the dimension of the array\n2.Shape: returns a tuple of integers indicating the size of the array\n3.Size: returns the total number of elements in the NumPy array\n4.Dtype: returns the type of elements in the array, i.e., int64, character\n5.Itemsize: returns the size in bytes of each item\n6.Reshape: Reshapes the NumPy array\n\nNumPy array elements can be accessed using indexing. Below are some of the useful examples:\n*A[2:5] will print items 2 to 4. Index in NumPy arrays starts from 0\n*A[2::2] will print items 2 to end skipping 2 items\n*A[::-1] will print the array in the reverse order\n*A[1:] will print from row 1 to end"
